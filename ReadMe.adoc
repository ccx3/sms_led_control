= Project: Control LEDs using SMS

Proof-of-concept project to control an LED via SMS.

This was made to help me understand the principle
of control via SMS. It is trivial to extend this
code to control other output devices - an LCD
display, a home-security project and so on.

== Step 1: Installation

1. Arduino UNO was used here.
2. Attach the GPRS shield + activated SIM card.
2. Set up breadboard with LED, 220ohm resistor, 
   all connected to the output pin and GND.
3. Send l-on / l-off / l-blink SMS to SIM number.
